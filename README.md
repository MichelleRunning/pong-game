# Pong Game (Python – Turtle Graphics)

This project was built to practice OOP, real-time input handling, collision detection, and modular game design in Python, while recreating the classic arcade game - **Pong game** - using the `turtle` graphics module.

## Game Features
- Two-player local gameplay
- Smooth paddle and ball movement
- Collision detection (walls & paddles)
- Increasing difficulty as the ball speeds up
- Live score tracking
- Modular, object-oriented design

---

## Technical Concepts 
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Python modules & file separation
- Turtle graphics
- Event listeners & keyboard controls
- Game loops
- Collision detection
- State management
